As a data and analytics engineer at Odido (formerly T-Mobile), my focus lies in crafting, executing, and sustaining data pipelines, databases, and analytical frameworks to bolster business intelligence and data-informed decision-making. My expertise encompasses the development of ETL processes, streamlining data workflows, and ensuring the integrity and dependability of data. I possess proficiency in various technologies such as SQL, Python, BI tools like ThoughtSpot, and cloud platforms like AWS, collaborating seamlessly with cross-functional teams to harness data as a strategic asset, fostering insights and innovation throughout the organization.

Below, I elaborate on the projects I've spearheaded and the responsibilities I've shouldered in my role as a senior data and analytics engineer at Odido.

# Project Background
At Odido, the Business Intelligence (BI) team is entrusted with data migration, ingestion, transformation, quality assurance, visualization, and documentation. We primarily handle data streams encompassing Finance, B2B (mobile and fixed data), and B2C (mobile and fixed data). Within the BI domain, several teams of proficient analytics engineers, equipped with profound domain expertise across these streams, collaborate cohesively to deliver high-caliber outcomes to internal stakeholders.

# B2C Fixed Team
The B2C fixed team is primarily tasked with managing Odido's fixed data ingestion, transformation, and visualization processes. Additionally, we successfully orchestrated the migration of data from Informatica to the AWS cloud, implemented rigorous data quality checks, and comprehensively documented all pipelines on Confluence.

My responsibilities within the B2C fixed team encompass a myriad of tasks, including:

## Data Ingestion: 
Utilizing tools like AWS DMS, Appflow, Lambda, and Sharepoint to ingest data from diverse sources.
## Data Transformation: 
Employing techniques such as data modeling, SQL, Python, and AWS Glue for data transformation, with AWS Redshift serving as our data warehouse.
## Business Intelligence: 
Leveraging ThoughtSpot as our primary BI tool at Odido, I'm responsible for crafting and delivering actionable insights to stakeholders.
## Team Management: 
In my capacity as a developer within a scrum team, I oversee developers' capacity and sprint planning.
## Tele2 Reports: 
Following the Tele2 acquisition by Odido, I've taken charge of generating B2C fixed data reports for internal stakeholders.

# Data Pipelines
## Customer Lifecycle Status
A pivotal data pipeline developed for the B2C fixed stream, this pipeline was engineered to comprehensively elucidate the lifecycle of fixed thuis customers, encapsulating various milestones such as application, activation, product additions, technology migrations, and address changes. This pipeline facilitates stakeholders in addressing queries pertaining to customer lifecycle trends.

## Case Ratio
The Case Ratio pipeline was crafted to decipher customer call patterns to Odido's customer care and the resolution of these cases. By quantifying customer calls and case resolutions over specific timeframes, this pipeline furnishes insights into customer support efficiency.

## IFRS Report
Fiber Network Coverage
This pipeline was devised to analyze the availability and coverage of Odido's new fiber network technology. It furnishes insights into the deployment of fiber technology across neighborhoods, homes covered, and applications for fiber connections.

##Other Pipelines
Recently Activated Customers Feedback Report
Fixed Sales Orders Pipeline
Fixed Churn Orders Pipeline

In designing these pipelines, we employed various data modeling techniques coupled with truncate and load, upsert, or SCD2 methods to facilitate data insertion into the data warehouse.
